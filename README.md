CISC 332 Final Project Implementation
Created by Ahoura Radpey
This is the implementation/demo part of the final  project for CMPE 332 - Database Management Systems W23.

The web page, built using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, accesses a MySQL database containing information about a branch of restaurants, and implements four functional requirements (as per the outline):

Show all the information for all drivers associated with a particular rescue organization
For a particular donor, show which organizations they donated to and the total amount donated (over their lifetime)
Show the total amount donated for 2018 to a selected organization
Show the animals that went from the SPCA directly to a shelter (ie. they did not go through the rescue organization)
The demo will take user inputs through a CSS form for the queries that require user input (1, 2, and 3), and will display either a table containing the requested information, or one line including the requested information. It will display

No results found.

if the result of any query is empty.
